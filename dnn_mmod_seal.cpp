/*
    This script code was modified from Davis King's example in http://dlib.net/dnn_mmod_dog_hipsterizer.cpp.html.

    This example shows how to train a CNN based object detector using dlib's 
    loss_mmod loss layer.  This loss layer implements the Max-Margin Object
    Detection loss as described in the paper:
        Max-Margin Object Detection by Davis E. King (http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00046).
    This is the same loss used by the popular SVM+HOG object detector in dlib
    (see fhog_object_detector_ex.cpp) except here we replace the HOG features
    with a CNN and train the entire detector end-to-end.  This allows us to make
    much more powerful detectors.

// The first thing we do is define our CNN.  The CNN is going to be evaluated
// convolutionally over an entire image pyramid.  Think of it like a normal
// sliding window classifier.  This means you need to define a CNN that can look
// at some part of an image and decide if it is an object of interest.  In this
// example I've defined a CNN with a receptive field of approximately 50x50
// pixels.  This is reasonable for face detection since you can clearly tell if
// a 50x50 image contains a face.  Other applications may benefit from CNNs with
// different architectures.  
// 
// In this example our CNN begins with 3 downsampling layers.  These layers will
// reduce the size of the image by 8x and output a feature map with
// 32 dimensions.  Then we will pass that through 4 more convolutional layers to
// get the final output of the network.  The last layer has only 1 channel and
// the values in that last channel are large when the network thinks it has
// found an object at a particular location.


// Let's begin the network definition by creating some network blocks.
